This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to data frame subsetting using the `%in%` operator. When a character vector used for subsetting contains elements that are not present in the data frame's column, the subsetting operation fails silently, without producing any warning or error. This can lead to unexpected results and make debugging difficult. The `bug.R` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.R` provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.
